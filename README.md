# SHINOBI

![Cover of videogame SHINOBI](https://i.blogs.es/7fdeb2/110409_shinobi/1366_2000.jpg)

Shinobi is basically a horizontal scrolling action game, in which the player moves to the right while taking down the enemies in his path, using his shuriken, a ninjato, and special ninja magic. Also an important objective is to rescue the kidnapped ninja children

Was a game that required above average skill as it did not have the same versatility of actions as others of its time, such as Ninja Spirit. Each phase had to be studied, especially from the moment when enemy ninjas could appear out of nowhere from a foot away. Trial and error to throw more coins in the arcade... And sharpening the aim with the shurikens to the maximum, also knowing in which parts it was appropriate to use the powerful magic.
